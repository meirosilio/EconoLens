EconoLens Project Outline

Project Objective: Analyzing how key economic indicators such as unemployment rates and consumer spending affect financial markets, identifying patterns, correlations, and potential causality.
Data Collection:
Obtain financial market data (stock indices, bond yields, etc.)
Obtain economic indicator data (unemployment rates, consumer spending figures, etc.)
Data Storage:
Set up a PostgreSQL database to store the collected data.
Organize data in a manner conducive to analysis, perhaps segregating financial and economic indicator data into separate tables.
Data Analysis:
Utilize SQL for initial data querying and aggregation.
Employ Python, with libraries such as pandas and sci-kit-learn, for more complex analyses, including correlation analysis, regression models, etc.
Visualization: Visualize findings using libraries like matplotlib or seaborn to illustrate the relationships between economic indicators and financial market performance.
Interpretation: Interpret the results to derive meaningful insights regarding the influence of economic indicators on financial markets.
Further Exploration: Explore additional economic indicators and their impacts, or delve deeper into identified correlations to understand underlying mechanisms.

Defining potential data sets: 
Unemployment Rate: Monthly or quarterly data on national unemployment rates.
Consumer Spending: Data on consumer expenditure across various sectors.
Consumer Confidence Index: A measure of consumer sentiments towards the economy.
Inflation Rate: Monthly or yearly data on inflation rates.
Interest Rates: Data on national interest rates set by central banks.
S&P 500 Monthly data.
